# SO2Socket

**SO2Socket** is a native C++ module targeting Android environments, designed to extend Unity-based mobile game functionality via memory patching, runtime hooking, encrypted communication, and real-time ESP overlays. Built using a combination of `KittyMemory`, `Dobby`, `xhook`, `xdl`, and custom vector/memory manipulation routines, the project leverages JNI and IL2CPP internals for seamless in-process enhancements.

## Key Features

- üîç **ESP Overlay Engine** ‚Äì Detects player positions and renders on-screen overlays via direct framebuffer coordinate projection.
- üéØ **Aimbot Core** ‚Äì Computes directional vectors using quaternion to Euler conversion, targeting the closest valid enemy object.
- üîê **Obfuscated Execution** ‚Äì OLLVM optimized, String encryption, function splitting, and annotation-based obfuscation strategies.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Memory Manipulation** ‚Äì Runtime memory patching through `KittyMemory`, including instruction patching, NOP injection, and dynamic hook registration.
- üì° **Encrypted UDP Data Streaming** ‚Äì ESP state is serialized with RapidJSON, XOR-encrypted, and transmitted over UDP sockets.
- üß† **Custom IL2CPP Resolver** ‚Äì Full method/class/field resolution using IL2CPP runtime metadata.
- üéÆ **Modular Weapon and Inventory Enhancer** ‚Äì Add all skins/items conditionally from JSON or defaults via dynamic dictionary injection.

## Dependencies

- Android NDK (C++17)
- [KittyMemory](https://github.com/MJx0/KittyMemory)
- [Dobby](https://github.com/jmpews/Dobby)
- [xhook](https://github.com/iqiyi/xhook)
- [xdl](https://github.com/hexhacking/xdl)
- [RapidJSON](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson)
- Custom headers for Unity structs (`Vector3`, `Quaternion`, etc.)
- IL2CPP runtime symbols

## Build Instructions

```bash
# Ensure Android NDK environment is set
Build with Android Studio (NDK r24 recommended)
```

## Usage

1. Inject compiled `.so` into Unity game process using a loader or Zygisk module.
2. Confirm `Unity` and `IL2CPP` libraries are loaded.
3. Initialize hooks, ESP manager, and worker threads.
4. Launch your ESP listener on UDP port `19133`.

## Security Considerations

- All strings are statically obfuscated (`OBFUSCATE` macro).
- Heavy use of C++ template-based junk code (`Bloat<N>`) and infinite recursion traps (`recurseForever`) as anti-analysis.
- Hardcoded integrity and tamper checks via `checkc()` function.
- Uses system properties and `/system/etc/hosts` contents to identify "debug" environments.
